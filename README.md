# Hello!

#### Just to say if you wanted to collaborate on a project ouside of the chainlink games one i would be up for that!

_my apologies for sending a readme commit but i am unsure if there is a better way to message on gh_

#### It is simply a small project between myself and a few compsci friends on our course, but if you wanted to try a smaller scale unity project, then go ahead!

##### I am also a little busy so i might not be mega invested but i am always looking to improve my skills

# :shipit: Either way, happy hacking! :shipit:
